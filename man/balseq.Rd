\title{Sequential balanced sampling}
\usage{
balseq(pik, Xspread, Xaux)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{A vector of inclusion probabilities.}

\item{Xspread}{A matrix of spatial coordinates.}

\item{Xaux}{A matrix of auxiliary variables. The matrix must contains the \code{pik} vector to have fixed sample size.}
}
\value{
A vector with elements equal to 0 or 1. The value 1 indicates that the unit is selected while the value 0 is for rejected units.
}
\description{
Selects at the same time a well-spread and a balanced sample using a sequential implementation.
}
\details{
The function selects a sample using a sequential algorithm. At the same time, it respects the balancing equations (\code{Xaux}) and select a well-spread sample (\code{Xspread}). Algorithm uses a 
linear program to satisfy the constraints.

\examples{
N=100
n <- 10
p=10
# pik=runif(N)
pik=inclprob(runif(N),n)
Xaux=array(rnorm(N*p,3,1),c(N,p))

Xspread <- cbind(runif(N),runif(N)) 
Xaux=cbind(pik,Xaux)
Xaux <- cbind(pik)

s <- balseq(pik,Xspread,Xaux)
